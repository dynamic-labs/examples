/**
 * Solana Transfer Adapter
 *
 * Implements `ChainTransferAdapter` for SVM. Imports only Solana dependencies —
 * the EVM adapter is a sibling and the two never reference each other.
 *
 * ## Idempotency on SVM
 *
 * There is no nonce to pin. A rebuild takes a fresh blockhash, which changes the
 * message and therefore the transaction id — a second execution. So the guarantee
 * is the **signed bytes**: sign once, persist them, and rebroadcast those verbatim
 * on retry. Solana dedups identical signatures, so a rebroadcast cannot execute
 * twice.
 *
 * Note the transaction id is `signatures[0]`, the *fee payer's* signature — the
 * sponsor's, here. So re-signing the wallet's `signatures[1]` does not produce a
 * second executable transaction, even though MPC signing is non-deterministic.
 * Rebuilding is the vector; measurements in IDEMPOTENCY.md.
 *
 * That inverts the EVM rule, where re-signing is safe as long as the nonce is
 * pinned. Getting either backwards double-spends.
