/**
 * EVM Transfer Adapter
 *
 * Implements `ChainTransferAdapter` for EVM. Imports only EVM dependencies — the
 * SVM adapter is a sibling and the two never reference each other.
 *
 * ## Idempotency on EVM
 *
 * The guarantee lives in the **intent nonce**, derived from `idempotencyKey`. The
 * delegate contract tracks spent nonces in a bitmap, so a given nonce is
 * consumable exactly once per wallet — every retry reproduces the same nonce and
 * the chain admits at most one. Nothing needs persisting for correctness; the
 * record is written for observability and to make retries cheap.
 *
 * This also survives re-signing, which matters because intents expire after 10
 * minutes and a long retry window forces a re-sign. Contrast `transfer/svm.ts`,
 * where rebuilding is what double-executes. See IDEMPOTENCY.md.
