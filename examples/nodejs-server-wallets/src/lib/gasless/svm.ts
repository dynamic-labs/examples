/**
 * Dynamic Native Gas Sponsorship (SVM)
 *
 * Solana sponsorship works differently from the EVM side, and more simply.
 * There is no delegation contract, no EIP-712 intent, and no relayer: Dynamic
 * takes your unsigned transaction, swaps the **fee payer** for its own sponsor
 * account, signs as that fee payer, and hands the transaction back. Your server
 * then adds the wallet's signature and broadcasts it itself.
 *
 * Two consequences worth understanding:
 *
 *  1. **Order matters.** Replacing the fee payer changes the transaction
 *     message, and therefore what gets signed. Sponsorship must happen *before*
 *     the wallet signs, or the signature covers a stale message and the
 *     transaction is rejected.
 *  2. **You broadcast.** Unlike EVM, no relayer submits for you, so an RPC
 *     endpoint is required and the transaction lands as soon as you send it.
 *
 * ## Two signing paths
 *
 * **Server wallets** use `signTransaction({ sponsor: true })`, which since SDK
 * 1.0.105 sponsors, signs, attaches the signature, and returns the transaction in
 * one call.
 *
 * **Delegated wallets** have to split it: they hold no caller-side key shares, so
 * `signTransaction` cannot sign for them. We call `sponsorTransaction()` explicitly
 * (API-token auth, no wallet key material), then sign with
 * `delegatedSignTransaction`, passing `signerAddress` — without it the SDK would
 * sign as the fee payer, which is now the sponsor, and we have no authority for
 * that account.
 *
 * Note this deliberately avoids the "custom fee payer" pattern in Dynamic's
 * docs, which requires your server to hold a funded Solana private key. Letting
 * Dynamic be the fee payer keeps raw key material out of the picture entirely.
 *
 * ## Requirements
 *
 * Gas sponsorship must be enabled for your environment in the Dynamic dashboard.
 *
 * ## Retries
 *
 * These functions are **not** retry-safe, because they **rebuild**. A fresh build
 * takes a fresh blockhash, which changes the message and therefore the transaction
 * id, so the retry executes a second time. (Re-signing alone is not the problem
 * when sponsored: the id is the sponsor's signature, so Solana dedupes it.)
 * Persist the signed bytes and rebroadcast those instead — see IDEMPOTENCY.md.
