/**
 * Idempotent Sponsored Transaction — SVM
 *
 * The rule from the EVM side **inverts** here, and getting it backwards
 * double-spends.
 *
 * There is no delegate contract, no intent, and no nonce to pin: Dynamic sponsors
 * by replacing the fee payer, and your server broadcasts. So nothing on-chain
 * dedupes "the same logical operation" — Solana only dedupes *identical signed
 * bytes*.
 *
 * ## Where the hazard actually is: rebuilding, not re-signing
 *
 * A Solana transaction's id is `signatures[0]` — the **fee payer's** signature.
 * Under sponsorship the fee payer is Dynamic's sponsor, not the wallet, and that
 * changes which step is dangerous. Measured on devnet:
 *
 *   - MPC Ed25519 signing *is* non-deterministic: signing one message twice yields
 *     two different, both-valid wallet signatures.
 *   - But those are `signatures[1]`. The transaction id is unchanged, so
 *     broadcasting either is **one** execution — Solana dedupes them.
 *   - Re-sponsoring the same built transaction is fully deterministic: same fee
 *     payer, same message bytes, same sponsor signature, same id.
 *   - **Rebuilding** takes a fresh blockhash. That changes the message, so the
 *     sponsor signature and the id change too — and the operation executes a
 *     second time.
 *
 * So the vector is the rebuild, and specifically the fresh blockhash. (On the
 * non-sponsored path the wallet *is* the fee payer, `signatures[0]` is its MPC
 * signature, and re-signing alone is enough to double-execute.)
 *
 * Either way the safe unit of retry is the **signed bytes**:
 *
 *   sign once -> persist the serialized transaction -> rebroadcast those bytes
 *
 * `--force` below rebuilds on purpose, and the second execution lands.
 *
 * ## What this demo does
 *
 * A 0-lamport self-transfer. No value moves and the sponsor pays the fee, so the
 * wallet needs no SOL — which is the point of sponsorship, and it keeps the demo
 * runnable on a fresh wallet.
 *
 * **The observable is the signature, not a balance.** Unlike the EVM demo (which
 * mints USDC, so a double execution shows as double the balance), there is no
 * free-mint equivalent on Solana devnet. So this demo reports the transaction
 * signature: one signature across runs means one execution, and two distinct
 * signatures mean the operation ran twice. The lamport balance is reported only to
 * show the wallet paid nothing — it stays flat either way.
