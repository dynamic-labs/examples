/**
 * Colors/spacing lifted from flow.dynamic.dev's marketing pages (its
 * `--brand-*` CSS custom properties and DM Sans typography) so this demo's
 * UI reads as visually related to Dynamic's own Flow demo site.
 *
 * Caveat: flow.dynamic.dev's actual wallet-connect/quote/status widget is
 * rendered client-side after the page hydrates, so its exact screens
 * weren't inspectable — this is a best-effort approximation built from the
 * site's marketing-page CSS and layout, not a pixel-exact clone. We also use
 * the system sans-serif font rather than DM Sans itself: bare React Native
 * needs the font file linked as a native asset to use a custom font, which
 * felt like unnecessary weight for a demo app.
