# Dynamic Examples & Starter Kits

**Build seamless Web3 experiences with embedded wallets, social login, and gasless transactions.**

This repository contains production-ready examples and starter templates for integrating [Dynamic](https://dynamic.xyz) - a complete wallet-as-a-service platform that enables developers to create Web3 apps without the complexity of wallet management.

## üöÄ **What is Dynamic?**

Dynamic combines authentication, smart wallets, and secure key management into one flexible SDK. Get the most multi-chain coverage across chains and third-party wallets.

## üöÄ **Getting Started**
